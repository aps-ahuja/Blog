      <h1>Mental health in today's life in India.</h1>
      <img src="mentalHealth.jpg" alt="renewable energy">
      <p>Hey there! Mental health is a topic that affects us all, and that's especially true in India. With its bustling
        cities, high-stress work environments, and cultural taboos surrounding mental health, it's no surprise that many
        people find it difficult to talk about their mental health challenges.

        But with changing times and the minds of people becoming more open-minded things are starting to change. Alot of
        mental health speacialists or speakers have started to speak out more about the topic of mental health and even
        the government has started to launch more initiatives regargding mental health and increase the access to their
        resources and services.
        <br>
        <br>Sometimes what our society does to people is that it supresses them and blocks their desire to speak about
        how they feel because of the old mindsets in people but there is definately a new ray of hope that we can see
        coming
        out in forms of alot more people starting to speak about at and working to reduce the stigma related to this
        topic and this article will also do just that and help you see the light through the dark tunnel that sometimes
        people are unable to see and they continue to fall back in the darkness when all they really need is someone to
        tell them that "it is okay to not be okay" and something along the lines of "This too shall pass" which could
        act as just the ray of hope needed to pull them out of the tunnel and save them.


      </p>
      <p>Mental health has been a topic of increasing concern in recent years, as more and more people around the world
        struggle with anxiety, depression, and other mental health challenges. In India, the situation is no different,
        and in fact, the cultural beliefs and societal expectations around mental health can make it even more difficult
        for individuals to seek help.<br>

      </p>

      <p>Mental health challenges in India are complex and multifaceted, with many factors contributing to the issue.
        One major challenge is the lack of mental health resources and infrastructure in the country. According to a
        report by the World Health Organization, there are only 0.3 psychiatrists per 100,000 people in India, compared
        to a global average of 1.2 psychiatrists per 100,000 people.
        <br><br>

        Additionally, cultural beliefs and stigma surrounding mental health can prevent individuals from seeking help,
        as many people fear being ostracized or discriminated against if they reveal their struggles as we noed earlier.
        Mental health challenges are often viewed as a personal weakness or a sign of spiritual or moral failing, rather
        than a legitimate medical issue.
      </p>

      <p>According to a study by the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), nearly 14% of
        India's population, or about 180 million people, are in need of mental health interventions. To tackle these,
        the government has started to take some initiatives.The Indian government has taken several steps to address
        mental health challenges in the country. In 2018, the government launched the National Mental Health Policy,
        which aims to provide accessible, affordable, and quality mental health care to all citizens. The policy also
        includes provisions for mental health education and awareness-raising programs, as well as measures to improve
        mental health research and data collection.
        <br><br>

        Beyond government initiatives, there are also many resources and programs available to support mental well-being
        in India. Traditional practices like yoga and meditation are widely recognized as effective tools for managing
        stress and improving mental health, and there are many centers and teachers throughout the country offering
        these practices to individuals and communities.

        But still after all of these the mental health sector in India is under-resourced and often overlooked in public
        policy and discourse. Even when resources are available, the stigma surrounding mental health can prevent people
        from accessing them.

        The mental health sector in India is under-resourced and often overlooked in public policy and discourse. Even
        when resources are available, the stigma surrounding mental health can prevent people from accessing them. It's
        not just up to mental health professionals, though. We all have a role to play in supporting mental health. This
        includes advocating for policies that promote mental health, creating supportive environments for those who are
        struggling, and taking care of our own mental health.
        <br><br>
        If you or someone you know is struggling with mental health challenges, it is important to know that you are not
        alone. It is okay to reach out for help and support. There are many resources available, including counseling
        services, support groups, and helplines, that can provide assistance and guidance.

        Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. It takes courage to acknowledge your struggles and
        reach out for support. By taking care of your mental health, you are taking an important step towards a happier,
        healthier life.

          So, let us all continue to prioritize our mental well-being and encourage those around us to do the same. Let
          us break the silence around mental health challenges and create a supportive and understanding society.
          Together, we can make a positive difference in the lives of millions of people in India and around the world.
